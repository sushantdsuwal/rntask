## Getting Started

This app is available on the [Expo](https://expo.io/ "Expo homepage") platform. After you have installed Expo onto your device you can run the app via this [link](https://exp.host/@sushantdsuwal/rntask) (the easier option) or by building your own copy. 

To build you own copy, clone this repository to your local machine and install it with the [yarn cli](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/) by running `yarn install`. 

With Expo installed, you can then run `expo start` to launch the app. 
Here are the scripts:

`npm run ios` - run the native react ios app in iOS Simulator
`npm run android` - run the native react android app in android Simulator
`npm run web` - run the app in web browser
